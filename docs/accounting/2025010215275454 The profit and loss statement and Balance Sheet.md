![[Pasted image 20250102165419.png]]
1. Green nodes:
	1. Assets:  stuff that you have
		1. money
		2. furniture and equipment. Things which you bought and you could sell again
		3. debtors : people/companies who owe you money
	2. liabilities/creditors: people/companies whom you owe money
2. Blue nodes:
	1. revenue: sales of your product/service
	2. expenses/overheads: the money you spent and not going get back. Examples: payroll, deprecations, food
3. Pink:
	1. Capital: money from investors or yourself that you got by selling shares
## Profit and loss statement
**The profit or loss of the company = Revenue - expenses**
ðŸ’¡ Load and credit card are not expenses. 
ðŸ’¡ The money that you didn't get yet(part payments) is a part revenue. 

In terms of Kleppmann:
The profit and loss statement: a list of all the blue nodes.
The profit or loss of the company: the sum of all of the blue nodesâ€™ balances. 

## The Balance Sheet
Equity(Capital + P&L) = Assets -  Liabilities
26862(1862 + 25000) = 26870 - 8 = 26862

In terms of Kleppmann:
Sum of the green nodes(assets,  liabilities/creditors)  + Sum ofÂ blue and pink nodes(capital, revenue, expenses) = 0
