# Architecture

```
The architecture of a software-intensive system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them.
```
comes from work done in the Software Architecture group of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

System Structures:
- static (design-time organization): might be modules, object-oriented classes or packages, database stored procedures, services, or any other self-contained code unit.
- dynamic (runtime organization): might be messages, parallel or sequential execution of internal tasks
Externally Visible System Properties:
- externally visible behavior: what the system does from the view-point of external observer. It defines the functional interactions between the system and its environment. Examples: API. External behavior may be modeled by treating the system as a black box
- quality properties: how the system does form the view-point of external observer. its nonfunctional characteristics. Quality property is an externally visible, nonfunctional property of a system such as performance, security, or scalability.

A good architecture is one that successfully meets the objectives, goals, and needs of its stakeholders.
