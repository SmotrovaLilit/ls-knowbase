# Viewpoint pitfalls

## Inconsistency
Using a number of views brings consistency problems. Checking consistency between views is a manual process
## Selection of the wrong set of views
Selection of views depends on:
- complexity of the architecture
- experience and skills of an architect
- experience and skills of stakeholders
- time 
## Fragmentation
To minimise the overhead of maintaining view you should eliminate views which  do not address significant concerns.
