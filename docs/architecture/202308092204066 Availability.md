# Availability
A system is available if it is able to perform its functionality (uptime/total time). [6](#references)
Reliability [[2023112801224646 Reliability]] implies availability but availability does not imply reliability.

**Percentage of availability = (total elapsed time â€“ sum of downtime)/total elapsed time**
SLA -  99.999

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Availability (%)**|**Downtime (per year)**|
|90% (one nine of availability)|36.53 days|
|99% (two nines of availability)|3.65 days|
|99.9% (three nines of availability)|8.77 hours|
|99.95% (three and a half nines of availability)|4.38 hours|
|99.99% (four nines of availability)|52.60 minutes|
|99.995% (four and a half nines of availability)|26.30 minutes|
|99.999% (five nines of availability)|5.26 minutes|

ðŸ’¡ To increase availability, you need redundancy.
## Challenges
- replication
- **customer redirection** DNS, load balancer
- **types of high availability**
	- active-passive
	- active-active
		- ðŸ’¡ Stateless applications work better for active-active systems
