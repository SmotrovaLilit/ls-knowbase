# Architecture definition process

**Architecture definition** or architectural design is a process in which are gathered stakeholders's requirements, and the architecture to meet those requirements is designed and described via an architecture description. 
This process consist of 3 stages which are normally performed iteratively. 
- Capture stakeholders needs
- Making a series of architectural design decisions
- Capturing the architectural design decisions made,  in an AD [[2023061502512222 Architecture description]]
This stages leads to creating architecture which must satisfy stakeholders's needs related functional and architectural(non-functional) requirements.

A good architecture definition process is one that leads to a good architecture, documented by an effective AD and can be realized in a time-efficient cost-effective manner.
