# Monolith
- ❌ A **monolith** has a rather expensive taste in hardware.
- ❌ Continuously grows and after some time requires complex and extremely pricey hardware and even more some times it is difficult to find such hardware
- ❌  Is always impossible scaling individual features of the monolith.  However, scaling the entire application can be achieved by manually deploying a new instance of the monolith on another server, typically behind a load balancing appliance - another pricey solution.
- ❌ Difficult expensive processes of  upgrades, patches or migrations of the monolith without downtime.
