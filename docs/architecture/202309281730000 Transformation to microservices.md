# Transformation to microservices
❌  Bad candidates for refactoring:
- legacy Mainframe based system, written in older programming languages - Cobol or Assembler
- applications tightly coupled with data stores

Stages
1. Incremental refactoring of legacy monolith to microservices
2. Design mechanisms or find suitable tools to keep alive all the decoupled modules to ensure application resiliency as a whole.
