# Message broker
Allows system to be more loosely coupled and failure resilient.

Key considerations when selecting a message broker:

- Does the broker adhere to established standards like AMQP and STOMP, or does it have a proprietary system?
- Durability — Will the broker deliver messages sent during a consumer's downtime once it reconnects?
- Concurrent Consumers — Can the broker handle multiple consumers competing for messages?

| Broker| Point-to-point | Publish Subscribe |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| JMS| Queue| Topic|  
| Kafka| Topic | Topic |  
| AMPQ-based such as RobbitMQ | Exchange + Queue | Fanout exchange and a queue per consumer|
| AWS Kinesis | Stream | Stream |
| AWS SQS | Queue | - |
Kafka don’t support distributed transactions.

Pros and cons 
- ✅ Loose coupling
- ✅ Failure resilient, allows to handle burst traffic
- ⛔ Additional operational complexity. The messaging system is yet another system component that must be installed, configured, and operated. 
- ⛔ Message broker must be HA and scalable.
