# Saga
Saga is ACD (Atomicity, Consistency, Durability)
Traditional approach(2PC, 3PC [2](#references)) to distributed transaction management isnâ€™t an option, see details in [1](#references)

## Challenges
-  [[2023101222375656  Lack of isolation between sagas]]
- Rolling back changes when an error occurs

## Coordinating sagas

### Choreography
- ðŸ’¡ Issue: you need to use a transactional outbox to ensure that a message achieves message broker.
- ðŸ’¡ Issue: you need to use correlation id, for example Order Id, do identify message information with database entity in the service. 
- âœ… Simplicity: Services publish events when they create, update, or delete business objects.
- âœ… Loose coupling
- â›” Difficult to understand: There isnâ€™t a single place in the code that defines the saga.
- â›” Cyclic dependencies between the services
- â›” Risk of tight coupling

This approach is better suitable for simple sagas. 

### Orchestration
- ðŸ’¡Use a state machine to model a saga orchestrator
- ðŸ’¡Issue: you need to use a transactional outbox to ensure that a message command achieves message broker.
- âœ… No  cyclic dependencies between the services
- âœ… Less coupling. Services just implemented command and doesn't need to know about all events 
- âœ…  Easier to understand
- â›”  Risk of centralising too much business logic in the orchestrator
