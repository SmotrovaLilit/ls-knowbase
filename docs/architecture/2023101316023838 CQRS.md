# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
## What issues are addressed by CQRS?
- Using the API composition pattern to fetch data distributed across numerous services often leads to costly and ineffective in-memory joins.
- Sometimes, the service responsible for storing data uses a format or database that does not efficiently support the necessary queries.
- The need to maintain a clear separation of concerns implies that the service in charge of data ownership may not be the ideal candidate for implementing query operations.
## Description of CQRS
![[Pasted image 20231013163718.png]]
ðŸ’¡ You can use another service for query view. It useful when query depends on data from different services.
## Pros and cons
âœ… Enables the efficient implementation of queries in a microservice architecture
âœ… Enables the efficient implementation of diverse queries. 
	Some NoSQL databases have very limited querying capabilities. 
	Using a specialized database for query is often more efficient
âœ… Makes querying possible in an event sourcing-based application
âœ… Improves separation of concerns
	The command side and query side are likely to be simpler and easier to maintain.
â›” More complex architecture
â›” Dealing with the replication lag. Solutions for this issue:
	- client updates model by using data returned in command
	- client updates data by using data in form. Client duplicates  server logic.

ðŸ’¡ you should use the API composition [[202310131459022 API composer]] whenever possible and use CQRS only when you must.
