# Load balancer
- distributes incoming web traffic across multiple backend servers
- allow applications 
	- âœ… scale up and down with demand
	- achieve HA 
- âœ… performance. By distributing the workload evenly across servers, load balancers can improve the average response time.
- âœ… **Reliability**. Load balancers provide redundancy and can minimize downtime by automatically detecting and replacing unhealthy servers.
- â›” single point of failure. You need to use multiple load balancers.  [DNS round robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS)Â can be used to balance traffic across different load balancers.
- â›” user sessions. The user's requests can be handled by different servers.
## Distributing traffic strategies
- Round robin
- Least connections
- Consistent hashing. like database sharding, based on IP address or URL
## Requirements to Load balancer:
- efficiency
- HA
## Implementation of LB
- HAProxy 
- Nginx
## Tips
- ðŸ’¡ In a microservice architecture, it's common to use load balancers in front of each internal service so that every part of the system can be scaled independently.
