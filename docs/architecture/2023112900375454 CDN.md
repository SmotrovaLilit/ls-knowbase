# CDN
Latency between California and China can be 3-4 seconds. 

## Approaches to implement CDN
- Push CDN
	- Origin server must save content in CDN
	- ⛔ more engineering work for the developers to make sure that CDN assets are up to date
- Pull CDN
	- CDN caches content in demand when users request it.
	- ✅ much easier to maintain
	- ⛔ if the CDN already have your asset cached, CDN won’t know if you decide to update it or not, and to fetch this updated asset
		- to minimise this problem CDN usually supports caching time using for example Cache Control  headers. Origin server should return in response Cache Control .
	- ⛔ the first request to a Pull CDN will always take a while since it has to make a trip to the origin server.
## CDN solutions
- Cloudflare CDN
- AWS Cloudfront
- GCP Cloud CDN

## When you shouldn't use CDN
- when your service’s target users are in a specific region
-  when  the assets being served are dynamic and sensitive. For example financial/government services
