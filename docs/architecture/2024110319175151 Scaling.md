# Scaling
## Web server Scaling

- vertical scaling(scale up) : adding more power(CPU, RAM)
	- ðŸ’¡ When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option
	- âœ… simplicity
	- â›” has a hard limit, it is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory
	- â›” does not have failover and redundancy
- horizontal scaling(scale out): adding more services into your poll of resources
	- ðŸ’¡ for large scale applications due to the limitations of vertical scaling
	- âœ…  failover and redundancy
	- â›” difficult
## Database Scaling
- vertical scaling(scale up) : adding more power(CPU, RAM)
	- ðŸ’¡ When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option
	- Amazon RDS 24 TB of RAM . For example, stackoverflow.com in 2013 had over 10 million monthly unique visitors, but it only had 1 master database
	- âœ… simplicity
	- â›” has a hard limit, it is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory
	- â›” does not have failover and redundancy
	- â›” The overall cost of vertical scaling is high. Powerful servers are much more expensive
- horizontal scaling(sharding): adding more services into your poll of resources
	- ðŸ’¡ for large data due to the limitations of vertical scaling
	- ðŸ’¡sharding key examples- user_id % 4
		- When choosing a sharding key, one of the most important criteria is to choose a key that can evenly distributed data.
	- âœ…  failover and redundancy
	- â›” complexity and new challenges
		- Resharding data
		- Celebrity problem.To solve this problem, we may need to allocate a shard for each celebrity. Each shard might even require further partition.
		- Join and de-normalization. A common workaround is to de- normalize the database so that queries can be performed in a single table.
