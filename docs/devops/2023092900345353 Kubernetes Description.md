# Kubernetes
_Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications_

Kubernetes is an orchestration system to deploy and manage containers.

Kubernetes was started by Google and, with its v1.0 release in July 2015, Google donated it to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF), one of the largest sub-foundations of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

From Google borg:
- API servers
- Pods
- IP-per-Pod
- Services
- Labels.
Kubernetes offers remarkable portability, allowing deployment in various environments, including local or remote Virtual Machines, bare metal, and across a range of cloud setups, be it public, private, hybrid, or multi-cloud. Additionally, Kubernetes can be extended with custom resources, operators, APIs, scheduling rules, or plugins to enhance its functionality.
