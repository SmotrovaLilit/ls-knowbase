# Worker node
Provides a running environment for client applications
Applications is incapsulated in pods. Pod is a smallest chedulingÂ work unit, consist of containers. 
ðŸ’¡ In a multi-worker Kubernetes cluster traffic with client users is not routed throw control plane, traffic is handled directly by the worker nodes. 
### Worker node Components
- Container Runtime![[Pasted image 20230929200501.png]]
	- [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/)
	- [containerd](https://containerd.io/)
	- [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/)
	- [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/container-runtime/)
- Node Agent - kubelet![[Pasted image 20230929201217.png]]
	- is an agent running on each node and communicates with control plane
	- interacts with the container runtime to run containers associated with the Pod, 
	- monitors the health and resources of Pods containers.
	- connects to container runtime throw Â [Container Runtime Interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md)Â (CRI)
		- **ImageService**Â  for all the image-related operations
		- **RuntimeService** Â for all the Pod and container-related operations
	- CRI shims
		- **cri-containerd**
		- **CRI-O**
		- **dockershim**Â andÂ **cri-dockerd**
- Proxy - kube-proxy
	- is a network agent running on each node and responsible for dynamic updates of all networking rules on the node.
	- is responsible forÂ TCP, UDP, and SCTPÂ stream forwarding
- Add-ons for DNS, Dashboard user interface, cluster-level monitoring and logging.
	- **Add-ons**Â are cluster features and functionality not yet available in Kubernetes, but implemented by 3rd-party pods and services.
		- - **DNS   
		- **Dashboard**
		- **Monitoring**
		- **Logging**
Usually [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is used for logging and monitoring
