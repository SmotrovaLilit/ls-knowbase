# ReplicaSet
[ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)
ReplicaSet helps to scale the number of pods, manually or using [autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/).
If one pod is forced to unexpectedly terminate, replicaSet checks pods health and create pod, thus ensuring that the current state matches the desired state. 

ReplicaSets can be used independently as Pod controllers but they only offer a limited set of features. Deployment is the recommended controller for the orchestration of Pods.
