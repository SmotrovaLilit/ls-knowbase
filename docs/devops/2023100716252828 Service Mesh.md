# Service Mesh
A **service mesh** is an architectural pattern used for managing the communication between microservices. It acts as an infrastructure layer that handles and abstracts away many of the network-related concerns associated with microservices. The key functions and features of a service mesh include:
- **Service Discovery**
- **Load Balancing**
- **Traffic Routing**
- **Security**
- **Distributed Tracing**
