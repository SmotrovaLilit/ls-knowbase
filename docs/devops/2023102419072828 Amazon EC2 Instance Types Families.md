# Amazon EC2 Instance type families
- General purpose instances: You can use it when you application needs memory, compute, networking resources roughly equivalent, because the application does not require optimisation in any single resource area.
	- application servers
	- gaming servers
	- backend servers for enterprise applications
	- databases
- Compute optimised instances: you can use it when you need compute optimised instances. 
	- batch processing workloads that require processing many transactions in a single group.
	- high-performance web servers
	- compute-intensive applications servers
	- dedicated gaming servers.
- Memory optimised instances: you can use when you need  to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory.
	- high-performance database 
	- workload that involves performing real-time processing of a large amount of unstructured data. 
- Accelerated computing instances: floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching.
	- graphics applications
	- game streaming
	- application streaming
- Storage optimised instances:  to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random IOPS to applications.
	- analytics performed on the records in a database.
	- application that has a high IOPS(input/output operations per second) requirement
	-  distributed file systems
	- data warehousing applications
	- high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
