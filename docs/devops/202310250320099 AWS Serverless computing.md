# AWS Serverless computing
- Computing with EC2 instances(virtual servers). 
	- You need to do:
		- Provision instances (virtual servers).
		- Upload your code.
		- Continue to manage the instances while your application is running.
	- When choose it:
		- You need full access to the OS
		- Host traditional applications
- **AWS Lambda**: a service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers. 
	- You need to do:
		- Upload your code.
		- Set your code to trigger
		- Lambda runs your code only when triggered.
		- You pay only for the compute time that you consume
	- When chose it:
		- Host short running functions
		- Service-oriented applications
		- Event Driven applications
		- And you don't want to manage servers and provision
- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)**: supports docker container and allows to use API calls to launch and stop Docker-enabled applications.
	- You need to manage instances EC2
	- When use it
		- You want to run docker container based workloads on AWS and use Amazon ECS as an orchestration. 
- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)**: supports k8s on AWS
	- You need to manage instances EC2
	-  When use it
		- You can choose it instead of ECS as an orchestration tool
- **AWS Fargate**: AWS Fargate manages your server infrastructure for you and works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.
	- You can use it instead of EKS or ECS when you don't want to manage EC2 instances
