## Amazon elastic block store(EBS)
 Pros and cons:
 - âœ… Sizes up to 16 TiB
 - âœ… Â Data persistence. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.
	 - Solid states by default
	 - HDD options
- âœ…Â incremental backups - Amazon EBS snapshots
	- ðŸ’¡The backups are stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones using Amazon S3.
- âœ… if you change files you can reupload only changed block.
- âœ…  HA: automatically replicated in its AZ
- âœ… Data encryption
- âœ… Flexibility. On-the-fly changes. Modify volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without stopping your instance.
- â›”  Availability Zone level resource. Stores data in aÂ **single**Â Availability Zone.
- â›” Volumes do not automatically scale
- â›” Need to be in the same availability zone to attach to EC2 instances
- â›” doesn't work with Lambda
- â›” Most EBS volumes can only be attached to a single EC2 instance at a time.

## When use it
- Operating systems
- Databases
- Entrprise applications
- Big data analytics engine
## EBS volume types
- SSD: for transactional workloads with frequent read/write operations with small I/O size
- HDD: Â are used for large streaming workloads that need high throughput performance
