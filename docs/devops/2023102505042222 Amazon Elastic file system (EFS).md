# Amazon Elastic file system (EFS)
Pros and cons:
- âœ…  Multiple instances reading and writing simultaneously
- ðŸ’¡Linux file system
- âœ… Regional resource: stores data in and acrossÂ **multiple**Â Availability Zones.
- âœ… automatically scales
- âœ… on-premises servers can access Amazon EFS using AWS Direct Connect.

ðŸ’¡ Compared to block storage and object storage, file storage is ideal for use cases in which a large number of services and resources need to access the same data at the same time.
