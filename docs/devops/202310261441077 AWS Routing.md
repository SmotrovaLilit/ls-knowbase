# AWS Routing
- VPC is created with the main route table.
	- by default main rout table  allows traffic between all subnets in the local network
- You cannot delete the main route table.
- You can:
	- replace the main route table with a custom subnet route table.
	- add, remove, and modify routes in the main route table.
- Subnet by default follow rules form the main route table
	- The main route table is used implicitly by subnets that do not have an explicit route table association.
- To route traffic from IG you need to create custom route table for subnet and add route to IG
