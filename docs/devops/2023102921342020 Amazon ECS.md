# Amazon ECS
It is container orchestration service.
ðŸ’¡ You are still responsible for maintaining the underlying EC2 instances.
## ECS Components
- Cluster: consists of services
- Service: consists of identical tasks
- Task: consist of containers
## ECS Options:
1. run your tasks and services on a serverless infrastructure that's managed by AWS Fargate [[2023103015443030 AWS Fargate]]
2. For more control over your infrastructure, you can run your tasks and services on a cluster of EC2 instances that you manage.
	- you need to install the Amazon ECS container agent on your EC2 instances.
	- ðŸ’¡ an EC2 instance with the container agent installed is often called a container instance.
	- What you can do:
		- run and stop containers
		- get cluster state
		- scale in and out
		- assign permissions
		- schedule the placement of containers across your cluster
		- achieve availability requirements
		- other..
	- You need to create json file described a task. For example:
```json
{
"family": "webserver",
"containerDefinitions": [ {
"name": "web",
"image": "nginx",
"memory": "100",
"cpu": "99"
} ],
"requiresCompatibilities": [ "FARGATE" ],
"networkMode": "awsvpc",
"memory": "512",
"cpu": "256"
}
```
