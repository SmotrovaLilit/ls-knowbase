# AWS Fargate
- Fargate abstracts the EC2 instance
- You’re not required to manage the underlying compute infrastructure.
- It works with ECS [[2023102921342020 Amazon ECS]] and EKS[[2023103015422323 AWS EKS]]
- This eliminates the need to choose and manage EC2 instances, cluster capacity, and scaling.
- Pay for requested compute resources when used.
