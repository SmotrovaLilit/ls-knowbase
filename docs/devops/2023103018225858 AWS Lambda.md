# AWS Lambda
- You can run your application  without having to manage any EC2 instances or containers
- HA and scaling is built in
- Application types:
	- data processing
	- real-time stream processing
	- machine learning
	- WebSockets
	- IoT backends
	- mobile backends
	- web applications
- You can configure labmda function using:
	- Lambda console
	- Lambda API
	- AWS CloudFormation
	- AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)
- You can invoke your function:
	- directly by using the Lambda API
	- you can configure an AWS service or resource to invoke your function in response to an event.

## Managing
- application framework
	- supports the package (ZIP archive to an Amazon S3 bucket) and deploy (deploy to AWS Lambda) steps 
- code repository
	- multiple Lambda functions per service
	- each service has own template, and use one repository per service and template
- development environment
	- separate prod and other environments in different AWS accounts
	- strategies for developers
		- one AWS for every developer if you have management process in place to handle it
		- use one AWS account for every developers
## Testing
### Local testing
- Unit tests
- Mocking options
	- DynamoDB local and LocalStack
	- Custom mocks
		- Require developers's time 
		- But it maybe less expensive in case when you are trying to test an application that relies on multiple services interacting with each other.
## Debugging
- You can't connect to remote lambda
- But you can use SAM CLI to connect to your application. You local version of application is updated in SAM CLI image and you can debug it.
