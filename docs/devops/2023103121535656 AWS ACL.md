# Network ACLs
- uses for subnets
- You can, for example:
	- allow only https traffic, you need to do in for in and out traffic
- It checks a packet before packet  can enter into a subnet/exit from a subnet by indicating who sent the packet and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet.
- Network ACLs is **stateless**
- ACL check request response too because it doesn't remember state. 
- By default:
	 -  default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic
	 -  custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic
