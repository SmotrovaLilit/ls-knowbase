# Security group
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.
- By default:
	- denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. 
	- you can associate EC2 instances with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance.
- uses **stateful** packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.
	- Security group remembers request and doesn't check response
