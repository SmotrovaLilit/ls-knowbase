# Amazon S3 versioning
- When versioning is enabled in an Amazon S3 bucket, each object automatically receives a distinct version ID. 
- Deleting an object doesn't permanently remove it; instead, S3 places a deletion marker on the object. This marker indicates a deletion attempt but allows for the object's restoration by simply removing the marker. 
- - Overwriting an object generates a new version while preserving access to its previous versions. To manage costs, consider deleting old object versions from your S3 bucket when they are no longer necessary.
## versioning states
- unversioned(default): all objects in bucked don't have a version
- enabled:  After you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state. However, you can suspend versioning on that bucket.
- suspended: All new objects in the bucket will not have a version. However, all existing objects keep their object versions.
