# AWS Load balancers

## ELB advantages:
- can distribute traffic across EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions
- also load balances to on-premises servers.
- HA
	- You need to be sure is that the load balancer's targets are deployed across multiple Availability Zones.
- Scalability
	- automatically scales to meet the demand of the incoming traffic
## ELB components
- Listener
	- Rule
- Target group
	- Targets

## ELB types
- application load balancer https/http,  layer 7
	- user authorisation
		- Open ID connect
		- - SAML
		- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
		- Microsoft Active Directory
	- rich metrics and logging
	- redirects
	- fixed response
	- sticky sessions
		- If requests must be sent to the same backend server because the application is stateful, use the sticky session feature.
- network load balancer tcp/udp, layer 4 
	- source IP address
	- low latency 
	- sticky sessions
	- static ip support
	- elastic ip address support
	- DNS failover
- gateway load balancer ip, layer 3,4
	- HA for third-party virtual appliances
	- gateway load balancer endpoints
	- health checks
	- monitoring using cloudWatch
	- private connectivity: connects internet gateways,  VPCs, and other network resources over a private network.
	- streamlined deployments
## Requirements to the target group
- health check mu be worked:
	- two types of health checks:
		- using TCP and marking the instance as available if the connection is successful
		- Making an HTTP or HTTPS request to a webpage that you specify and validating that an HTTP response code is returned
