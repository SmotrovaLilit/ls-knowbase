# GO's Weaknesses

- **Less Mature Ecosystem.   While Go has a strong standard library, its ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks is not as extensive as some other languages like Python or Java. 
- **Limited Metaprogramming**. Go intentionally restricts metaprogramming capabilities.
- In Go, the binary size is larger compared to some other compiled languages because the runtime components, including the garbage collector (GC) and goroutine management, are bundled into the binary.
