# Open Security

Even if attacker knows how the system's security is implemented , attacker should still be thwarted. 

## Why we need to follow this principle
1.  When we use open-source projects security is better because opened functions and algorithms of the system can be reviewed by the security community and improved against attacks.
2. The source code may be stolen, but the system should remain secure.
