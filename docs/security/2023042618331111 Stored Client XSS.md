# Stored Client XSS

Stored client XSS refers to an XSS attack where an attacker stores a payload on a website, and then this payload is retrieved by the victim's machine and executed in JavaScript on the client-side.

It is like stored server XSS but payload is not in DOM, payload located in JS functions and will have been added in DOM  by JS code. 
**Example**:
When we send payload server return our payload in the response and then JS inserts this payload in DOM using method "append" like this:
```js
$(#data).append(payload);
```

Payload example
```html
<script>alert();</script>
```
