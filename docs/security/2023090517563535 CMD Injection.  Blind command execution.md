# Blind command execution
Let's consider a case when an application doesn't  return result of command execution. 
How can we check availability to execute command:
We can use command sleep and compare response time of normal request and request with sleep payload. 
Normal request:
```bash
time curl "http://example.com?ip=127.0.0.1"
```
With sleep payload request
```bash
time curl "http://example.com?ip=127.0.0.1;sleep%2020"
```
